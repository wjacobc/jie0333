This scientific statement discusses the potential cardiovascular complications of exercise, their pathological substrate, and their incidence and suggests strategies to reduce these complications. Exercise-associated acute cardiac events generally occur in individuals with structural cardiac disease. Hereditary or congenital cardiovascular abnormalities are predominantly responsible for cardiac events among young individuals, whereas atherosclerotic disease is primarily responsible for these events in adults. The absolute rate of exercise-related sudden cardiac death varies with the prevalence of disease in the study population. The incidence of both acute myocardial infarction and sudden death is greatest in the habitually least physically active individuals. No strategies have been adequately studied to evaluate their ability to reduce exercise-related acute cardiovascular events. Maintaining physical fitness through regular physical activity may help to reduce events because a disproportionate number of events occur in least physically active subjects performing unaccustomed physical activity. Other strategies, such as screening patients before participation in exercise, excluding high-risk patients from certain activities, promptly evaluating possible prodromal symptoms, training fitness personnel for emergencies, and encouraging patients to avoid high-risk activities, appear prudent but have not been systematically evaluated.", "url": "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.181485"}, {"headline": "Neglected tropical diseases: WHO launches new road map to end suffering by 2030", "source": "WHO", "tags": ["Disease"], "publish_date": "1/30/21", "last_revision": "", "snippet": "On Thursday 28 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally launched a new ten-year plan that aims to end the suffering of more than one billion people from neglected tropical diseases.\n\nThe moderated event on Zoom brought an audience of 2623 at its peak, with a further 1230 views on YouTube.
